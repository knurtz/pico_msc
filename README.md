# Pico MSC
This is a small mass storage module for Raspberry Pi Pico. The library can be included in any Pico SDK project. It will assign a portion of the onboard flash to a tiny mass storage partition, which can be accessed from a host computer via USB. This can be used to easily transfer files like configuration data, images to be displayed, sound files to be played or anything else to a Pico SDK application.
